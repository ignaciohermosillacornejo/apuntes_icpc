# Competitive programing notes
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/N9199/apuntes_icpc.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/N9199/apuntes_icpc)
## Introduction

This repository holds all the boilerplate code que that I and my team use during training and actual competitions. Almost all .cpp files are ready to be copied and pasted, including relevant comments. However, for anyone using this repository, we must caution that a good understanding of the code and the theory behind it is needed in order to be effective using it, as it will most likely need some form of modifications for your particular problem.

## Printable version

It is posible to auto generate a .pdf file for print based on all the content on the repository. In order to do this, you must compile the main.tex file.

## Future updates

Pull requests are welcome, as well as any suggestions by opening an issue or writing to my [mail](namcdonnell@uc.cl).

## Special Thanks

To my teammate and the original creator of this repo, [Ignacio Hermosilla](https://github.com/ignaciohermosillacornejo). To my coach [Pablo Messina](https://github.com/PabloMessina) who provided a template and some of the code from his notes. And to everyone who has contributed to finding bugs and expanding the repo.
